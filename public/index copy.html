<h1>Best Movies According to Addison</h1>

<h2>Addison's Top Six Of All Time <i>IN MY OPINION
</i></h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>I watched the movie as a kid and enjoyed
it for the dinosaurs and the spectacle.
But as I kept watching into adulthood, I found 
many lessons and themes that I carry with me today.</p>

<h3>The Mummy</h3>
<p>This movie has one of the best blends of action, comedy, suspense,
and romance. Truly a peak pulp experience where one can simply
enjoy the ride and it not feel like you're turning your brain 
completely off.</p>

<h3>Forbidden Kingdom</h3>
<p>This movie takes a kid who grew up in Jersey and due to the power
of the Monkey King's staff in the possession of an old pawn shop owner, is
transported to an alternate wuxia fantasy world. The action and
the adventure are the biggest pulls for this movie and the development
of the main character by the end is really satisfying.</p>

<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>This movie scared me at first as a kid, but what pulled me in was the action.
The Matrix put me on to the cyberpunk genre. However looking back,
I appreciate that it didn't use the same cyberpunk aesthetics. However, it
does play off one of my favorite cyberpunk tropes which is the human
element vs technology.</p>

<h3>The Karate Kid</h3>
<p>This movie inspired me to take up martial arts myself and to always
look beneath what things may look like on the surface and that there
can always be a lesson in the most mundane things.</p>  

<h3>Van Helsing</h3>
<p>This movie has my favorite representation of vampires and werewolves in a dark
fantasy movie. The theme I liked from the movie were the fact that humans, vampires,
and werewolves all contemplated their own existence and what it means to live in a world
like theirs. Vampires had clutches of offspring that were killed, werewolves were
hunted by humans and by vampires to serve as their slaves, and Frankenstein's 
monster having been a patchwork creation of many different entities, had to find where he
ended up in this chaotic ecosystem.</p>
